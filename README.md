# Music Generation using Deep Learning

LSTM Model :
Training :

Run the train_LSTM_model.ipynb file after installing appropriate librabries which are required.

Generating Music :

Pre- trained model file can be found here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Enn08X6JkZqWrFCK94ZXFIVY4gkqg_N/view?usp=sharing

Download this file and then run Generating Music/LSTM Model/ music_gen_generate_midi.ipynb file  

This should generate a midi file which will stored in the same folder

Autoencoder Model :

Training :
Run the train_autoencoder_model.ipynb file after installing appropriate librabries which are required

Generating Music :

Pre- trained model file can be found here :

numpy files link :

lengths.npy : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5z3THegAkp08JWb74BOZiGvRSIs_dWM/view?usp=sharing

samples.npy : https://drive.google.com/file/d/15g9DhLnXYFfXKQFDchvefVwGuu8B5Ptu/view?usp=sharing

All these files are necessary to generate the music. Download these files and then run Generating Music/Autoencoder Model/ live_edit_music_gen.ipynb file.

This should open an application with the help of which music can be generated
